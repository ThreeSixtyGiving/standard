# Technical information
For open data to be really useful it has to follow an agreed format – a standard – so it can be easily compared with data from other organisations.

For UK grantmakers, we have developed the 360Giving Data Standard for this purpose. We use this standard to make sure that when all your data is linked to the 360Giving Data Registry, it can be easily "read" by different applications. This is how we make sure that when you use the data, the information can be compared.

The 360Giving Data Standard is:
- Open data driven: providing a common way to share transparent and interoperable information on grantmaking.
- Easy to use: offering a simple spreadsheet format for publishing and using data, backed up by a structured data model, developer-friendly JSON serialisation, and conversion tools.
- Comprehensive:  Supporting in-depth analysis of grants, grantees, and beneficiaries to provide a 360 degree view of grantmaking.

This section of this site provides the technical reference information on publishing using the 360Giving Data Standard.

The content assumes some technical knowledge.

In this guidance you will find:
