# Guide for grants to individuals
360Giving has worked in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.aco.uk.net/" target="_blank">Association of Charitable Organisations (ACO)</a>, the membership body for charities that provide financial and wellbeing support to individuals, on a joint programme to develop the <a href="https://www.360giving.org/about/data-standard/" target="_blank">360Giving Data Standard</a> to enable the sharing of open data about grants to individuals.

This guide provides templates, guidance and codelists designed to support funders of grants to individuals with responsible publishing of data about their grants using the 360Giving Data Standard which protects the privacy of individual recipients.
