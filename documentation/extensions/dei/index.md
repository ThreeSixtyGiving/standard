# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Extension

This section provides publisher guidance and documentation for the DEI Extension provided by 360Giving. The DEI Extension is an extension to the 360Giving Data Standard which allows [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Data Standard](https://www.funderscollaborativehub.org.uk/dei-data-standard) data to be published alongside [360Giving Data Standard](https://www.360giving.org/about/data-standard/) data so that it can be validated and used in 360Giving tools.

The DEI Data Standard is developed and maintained by the [DEI Data Group](https://www.funderscollaborativehub.org.uk/collaborations/dei-data-standard), with technical support provided by 360Giving. Information about the DEI Data Standard is hosted on their section of the Funders Collaborative hub.

The DEI Extension has been developed and is maintained by [360Giving](https://360giving.org/) to support new and existing 360Giving publishers to include DEI Data Standard data in their 360Giving data files.

The following guidance provides further information about the DEI Extension, DEI Data Standard and how to prepare and publish DEI data alongside 360Giving data.
