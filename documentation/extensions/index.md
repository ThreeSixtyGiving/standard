# Extensions Documentation

360Giving provides a core set of fields which are designed to make it useful and usable for people to collect, share, and analyse data about grantmaking.

Publishers often collect and wish to publish information which is not part of the 360Giving standard and there are important topics that intersect with the concerns of grantmakers but which do not necessarily warrant an update to the standard by themselves. In these cases, it may be appropriate to develop and use an extension for 360Giving.

Extensions add fields and validation rules which allow 360Giving publishers to include additional data in their publication in a way that enables it to be checked for validity and quality, as well as integrate better into the 360Giving data ecosystem.

This section contains documentation about each extension for 360Giving.
