## Guide to 360Giving Open Data Licensing

### About this Guide

This guide is for organisations publishing grantmaking information to the 360Giving format. We assume that you have permission to publish the information if you are not the primary owner. For example, if the information was collected or published by donors, subsidiaries or other third parties.

### What is open data?

Open data is data available to everyone to use and share without restrictions. Open data is non-personal data released by people, organisations and governments.

You are probably using open data without realising it. An example could be getting around London with real-time travel updates thanks to [CityMapper](https://citymapper.com "Citymapper - The Ultimate Transport App"), which uses open data from Transport for London and OpenStreetMaps amongst others. Or it could be getting up-to-date with the state of the voluntary sector with the [NCVO Almanac](https://data.ncvo.org.uk/ "NCVO UK Civil Society Almanac") which uses open data from the Charity Commission and Companies House.

### Why license 360Giving data?

Without a license, data isn't open data and potential users wouldn't know what they are allowed to do with it. At 360Giving, we believe that with better information, grantmakers can be more effective and strategic decision makers. To achieve this, 360Giving recommends using an open license which removes restrictions on anyone interested in using, sharing and understanding the grants landscape.

### Which license should you choose?

While there are several choices for open data licenses, we recommend a license that doesn't restrict use but does acknowledge you, the publisher. To this end, our default recommendation is the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

With this license, anyone can share or adapt your data for any purpose, even commercially. The only restrictions are they must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and note any changes made. [Find out more about CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International").

If you are a UK public sector organisation, we encourage you to use the [Open Government License](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/ "Open Government License for public sector information"). This is the UK government's open data license which public sector bodies are encouraged to use by the [Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015 (RPSI)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-rpsi/ "Guide to RPSI").

### Where to display the license?

As part of publishing to the 360Giving standard, we encourage publishers to register with our helpdesk, produce, then upload files to their websites. To make the data easy to discover, you can add a page or section to your website that links to the files. This is the best place to display your chosen license. Don't forget to pop our helpdesk a note so we know your data is published and under what license.

### Is there an example of a license statement?

Here's an example of a license statement based on our recommended CC BY 4.0 license. Simply replace the words in square brackets with information about your organisation and grants.

> [Organisation] is committed to transparency and we work with 360Giving to publish information about our grants.
>
> Using the 360Giving data standard, our awarded grants since [Year] are available as [File Type] here.
>
> This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. To view a copy of this license, visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. This means the data is freely accessible to anyone to be used and shared as they wish. The data must be attributed to [Organisation].
>
> We believe that with better information, grantmakers can be more effective and strategic decision makers. 360Giving provides support for grantmakers to publish their grants data openly, to understand their data, and to use the data to create online tools that make grant making more effective.
