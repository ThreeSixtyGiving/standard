## JSON Feeds

### Registry

A JSON feed is available at
[https://data.threesixtygiving.org/data.json](https://data.threesixtygiving.org/data.json). The JSON is an array of objects in the following format:

### Metadata

360Giving provides [a JSON feed](https://storage.googleapis.com/datagetter-360giving-output/branch/master/status.json) that contains metadata about files in the registry, including file statistics (including size, location, validity against the standard), aggregate statistics (including total grants, values, and dates) and useful insights (including identifier schemes used).

Additionally, a [CSV report](https://gist.github.com/30d835ae16e2a30efde8a63acf03628d) is available, which contains a subset of the fields available in the JSON feed, focussed on the aggregate statistics.

## Downloading Data

[datagetter](https://github.com/ThreeSixtyGiving/datagetter) downloads all of the data that is listed in the registry, and converts it to JSON for use in an application.
