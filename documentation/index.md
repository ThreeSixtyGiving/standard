The 360Giving Data Standard
================================

**For open data to be really useful it has to follow an agreed format – *a standard* – so it can be easily compared with data from other organisations.**

For UK grantmakers, we have developed the 360Giving Data Standard for this purpose. We use this standard to make sure that when all your data is linked to the [360Giving Data Registry](https://data.threesixtygiving.org/), it can be easily “read” by different applications. This is how we make sure that when you use the data, the information can be collated and compared.

The 360Giving data standard is:

* **Open data driven:** providing a common way to share transparent and interoperable information on grantmaking.
* **Easy to use:** offering a simple spreadsheet format for publishing and consuming data, backed up by a structured data model, developer-friendly JSON serialisation, and conversion tools.
* **Comprehensive:** supporting in-depth analysis of grants, grantees, and beneficiaries to provide a 360 degree view of grantmaking.

Free support is <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/contact/" target="_blank"> available from our support team</a> to help you to publish and use 360Giving data.

Full schema documentation is [available in the Reference section](reference).
