# Next steps once you've published your data

## Document your publishing process

We recommend documenting your internal process for publishing your grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard. This will make it easier when you need to make updates to your data, particularly if you intend to update on an annual basis as it can be easy to forget the process if done infrequently.  

It will also be valuable if someone new takes responsibility for publishing your data. 

You may want to make a note of:
- The range of data you are publishing, and where it can be found in your systems or reports.
- The practical steps you take to transform the data into 360Giving format.
- Any data protection or responsible data checks and changes are needed before the data is ready for publishing.
- Who is involved in checking or signing off the data?

## Updating your 360Giving data

### Updating & Publishing

#### How often you should update your data

This decision is up to each publishing organisation to decide and should be informed by your grantmaking cycles and capacity. However, the minimum good practice is to update data on an annual basis.

Many organisations choose to publish annually, some publish every six months or quarterly, with others doing an update following each grant award round. 

The aim is to have timely information available - but what ‘timely’ means will be different for different organisations, depending on circumstances and how often grants are awarded.

#### How to make updates to your data

When you have more grant data to publish you will follow the same steps you used to prepare your data. 
 
Once the data is ready and it has passed the Data Quality Tool tests you can either: 
- Add the new grant data into the existing file of published data and re-upload the file to your website. If you can keep the file name and the position of the file the same following an update it will mean the link from the Data Registry to your data will stay the same – so your updates will automatically get picked up in our system.
- Upload a new file alongside your existing file, add a link to the file from your hosting page and let the 360Giving Helpdesk know about the new file.

#### Letting 360Giving know about updates to your data

If you publish a new file of data, or if your existing data file has been updated and the location or name of your data file has changed, you need to let 360Giving know so the Data Registry can be updated with the new file links.
Remember to remove any old files from your website when making updates. 

If your 360Giving data file has a generic name and it is uploaded to a consistent place in your website then any subsequent updates you make to the file will get picked up by the Data Registry automatically because the link to your file will be unchanged.

#### Making changes to your published data

You can make changes to your data at any time. This may be to add new grants data or amend details or to fix typos. It might also be to remove grants that were awarded but didn’t go ahead, or to amend grants that have been varied in some way. 
 
For further guidance about making changes to your data to note variations to your grants, [see our guidance](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/2020/04/20/covid19-guidance-on-tagging-and-tracking-changes-to-existing-grants/).
 
Making amendments to your 360Giving data can be done manually, by taking a copy of your published data file and making the necessary changes. You then save the file and re-upload it to your website, replacing the current file.
 
The process to make an update of your data might involve running the same report from the earlier grant data but increasing the latest grant date to cover the period you want to update to. This report will include information about grants you've already published and newer grants, reflecting any changes that have been made in your system since you last published your data. 
 
However this process is only possible if you do not make significant changes to your data to get it ready for publication, so that the information in your system matches what is in your 360Giving data file.  If you have edited the information in the file – for example to amend description text to make it suitable for publishing openly – then you will need to manually amend or remove grants in your existing published grants data.

#### Changing how your name appears in 360Giving tools

The name of the funding organisation that appears on GrantNav and 360Insights is derived from the 360Giving data that is published. This means that to update how your name appears you need to update the text in the Funding Org:Name column in your data, and then re-publish the file(s).

The name that appears on the 360Giving Data Registry is controlled by 360Giving. For any queries about the process to change the name in your data, and to request an amendment to the 360Giving Data Registry please contact the 360Giving Helpdesk via support@threesixtygiving.org.

### Deleting data

#### Taking down published data

A fundamental aspect of publishing using the 360Giving Data Standard, and publishing open data in general, is that once the information is released it may be downloaded and used by anyone.
An organisation is free to decide to stop publishing data and/or can remove the data from their website, however the information that has been published may still be held and used by anyone who has already downloaded it.

360Giving has a [Take Down policy](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/take-down-policy/) for the data linked from our Data Registry and loaded into our tools, so we will remove any published data on request.
