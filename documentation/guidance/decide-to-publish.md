# Deciding to publish 360Giving data

## Why publish 360Giving data
Over 200 funders now publish their grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard, meaning that over £100bn of grants data can be looked up, compared and analysed across the UK.

This brings lots of benefits, both for the funders who publish their grants data and for society.

### Benefits for funders
Publishing your grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard benefits your funding organisation in numerous ways.

- **It helps you understand yourself better**. The publishing process encourages you to consider what information you collect, how you want to present it, and what information is missing. Once your data is published, it is easy to analyse and visualise it using our 360Insights tool. This helps when you want to report on your funding, check assumptions you have, or monitor progress against your organisational strategy.

- **It sends a message to your grantees and fellow funders**. Openly publishing your data sends a message to fellow funders, grantees and wider society that you are part of the open grants movement. It means you are doing your bit to help make grantmaking in the UK more joined up, informed and effective.

- **You can join a peer-network of Data Champions**. Publishing organisations can also apply to join our Data Champions programme, a peer-network for people in funding organisations looking to learn how to use data to make more informed decisions, and improve the effectiveness of their grantmaking.

### Benefits for society
Information is an asset. It is also knowledge and power. With 360Giving data, we can map the landscape of UK funding so that anyone can easily find who is funding what, how much and what for.

- **It saves time and money for the sector**. When financial flows from funders to beneficiaries are opaque, it increases costs for all in the sector – collaboration between funders is harder; due diligence is done with limited information and grant applicants face significant information barriers to find out who might fund them.

- **It gives us a fuller picture of grantmaking in the UK**. If we can see where grants go across the country, we can spot trends and find out important things like which areas are under-funded.

- **It helps bring better outcomes for recipients**. By saving resources and enabling better, more targeted funding decisions, 360Giving data helps funders focus on what’s most important: meeting the needs of their beneficiaries – the people, organisations and causes that they want to support.

## 360Giving Data Standard
For open data to be really useful it has to follow an agreed format – a standard – so it can be easily compared with data from other organisations.

For UK grantmakers, we have developed the 360Giving Data Standard for this purpose. We use this standard to make sure that when all your data is linked to the 360Giving Data Registry, it can be easily "read" by different applications. This is how we make sure that when you use the data, the information can be compared.

The 360Giving Data Standard is:
- Open data driven: providing a common way to share transparent and interoperable information on grantmaking.
- Easy to use: offering a simple spreadsheet format for publishing and consuming data, backed up by a structured data model, developer-friendly JSON serialisation, and conversion tools.
- Comprehensive:  Supporting in-depth analysis of grants, grantees, and beneficiaries to provide a 360 degree view of grantmaking.

Free support is available from our support team to help you to publish and use 360Giving data.

Full schema documentation is in the [Reference section](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/reference/).

### An open standard
The 360Giving Data Standard is an open standard. You can get involved in shaping the development of the standard through:
- [The 360Giving forum](https://forum.threesixtygiving.org/): open for general discussions about the standard and proposed updates.
- [The issue tracker for the standard](https://github.com/ThreeSixtyGiving/standard/issues): for bug reports.You can also contact the 360Giving support team with your questions and suggestions via support@threesixtygiving.org
- The [Governance and Revision Control](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/governance/) section provides further information about how proposed updates to the 360Giving Data Standard are assessed and prioritised for implementation.

#### 360Giving data
360Giving data is the term we use to describe any grant information shared using the 360Giving Data Standard. The 360Giving data it can be viewed in files published by by a wide range of funding organisations or explored in online tools built by 360Giving and others.

#### Publishers and publishing
Organisations that share 360Giving data are the owners of the information and when they make the files of data available online as open data, it is called **publishing the data**. That is why the funders that share 360Giving are called **Publishers**.

#### JSON
The 360Giving Data Standard is defined by a JSON Schema, which describes the structure and attributes of the information can be shared. JSON, which stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, is a data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data in web applications.
