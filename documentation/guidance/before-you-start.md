# Deciding if you want to publish

## The benefits of publishing 360Giving grants data

Publishing grant data using the 360Giving Data Standard brings lots of benefits, both for the funders who publish their grants data and for society. Read about them at https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/why-publish-grants-data.

## An Open standard

The 360Giving Data Standard is an open standard. You can get involved in shaping the development of the standard through:
- [The 360Giving forum](https://forum.threesixtygiving.org/): open for general discussions about the standard and proposed updates.
- [The issue tracker for the standard](https://github.com/ThreeSixtyGiving/standard/issues): for bug reports.You can also contact the 360Giving support team with your questions and suggestions via support@threesixtygiving.org
The [Governance and Revision Control](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/governance/) section provides further information about how proposed updates to the 360Giving Data Standard are assessed and prioritised for implementation. 

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for anyone from a UK funding organisation who wants to publish their grants data openly in the 360Giving Data Standard. 

This guide will help organisations publish data for the first time. It will also be useful to:
- People taking over responsibility for preparing and sharing 360Giving data for their organisation from a colleague.
- Anyone who wants to know more about what sharing 360Giving data involves.

It is designed to help you at any stage of the publishing process – whether you are at the very beginning of your journey and planning your approach, preparing your data, at the publishing stage, or looking for ways to promote the fact you have published, and start using the data in 360Giving tools.

We want to help you achieve your goal of publishing open and comparable grants data using the 360Giving Data Standard. This isn’t a reporting process, it’s an opportunity to let people know about your grantmaking using data.

Our pro-bono support helps funders to navigate the steps to publish their grant data using the 360Giving Data Standard. We provide guidance and direct support to help streamline the process as far as possible.

At any point in this process we invite you to contact our free Helpdesk via support@threesixtygiving.org with any queries, large or small.

# Useful information before you start planning

## The process: what to expect

### Plan

Identify the scope of the grant information you want to share by looking at the data in your systems, and comparing it with the available 360Giving Data Standard fields. You can also take inspiration from what other funders have included in their 360Giving data. Once you have identified the grant information you intend to publish, you can consider if there are privacy and responsible data implications of sharing this data.

### Prepare

Your grant information needs to be transformed into 360Giving data, using the correct formats and headings. You can use the 360Giving Data Quality Tool to check your data is formatted correctly.

For many publishers, preparing their data is a manual process that involves converting data exported into a spreadsheet from a grants management system. However, some grants management systems make it possible to export data with some or all of the preparations needed to convert the information into 360Giving data built-in.

### Publish

Your prepared file of 360Giving data needs to be made available online accompanied with an open license, which provides clear permissions to allow for its use by 360Giving and others. This step usually involves uploading the file to your website and linking to the file with text referring to the open license. The final step is to let 360Giving know that your data has been published.

Once your file of 360Giving data has been published openly, a link to it will be added to the [360Giving Data Registry](https://data.threesixtygiving.org/). Your grant data will then start to appear in GrantNav, 360Insights and other tools and platforms that use 360Giving data.

### Publishing resources for community foundations

If you are a community foundation using the Digits2 grants management system, please refer to our special guidance about the built-in 360Giving data extract for publishing 360Giving data. (Link to be added)

### The Helpdesk

There are no registration fees or costs associated with publishing your grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard. 360Giving support for publishers is provided free of charge. 

Preparing 360Giving data does require a commitment of resources from the publisher in terms of staff time, especially when publishing your data for the first time. There can be costs in terms of consultancy or support fees for getting grants management systems set up to export 360Giving data. 

## About grants management systems

Grantmakers of all shapes and sizes have become 360Giving data publishers, using a wide range of grants management systems and some by collecting basic data in spreadsheets.

Where and how you collect and store information about your grants has a fundamental impact on the data you will be able to share. This will also influence the practical process taken to format your data to the 360Giving Data Standard. 

One of the first questions we’ll ask you when you start on your 360Giving publishing journey is what grants management systems you use. Whatever the answer, there will be useful learning we can share from our work supporting over 150 other publishers.

*See the ‘Prepare’ section for further details about the likely impact your grants management system will have on the publishing process.* (Link to be added)
