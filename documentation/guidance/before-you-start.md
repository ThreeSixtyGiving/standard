## The benefits of publishing 360Giving grants data

Publishing grant data using the 360Giving Data Standard brings lots of benefits, both for the funders who publish their grants data and for society. Read about them at https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/why-publish-grants-data.

## An Open standard

The 360Giving Data Standard is an open standard. You can get involved in shaping the development of the standard through:
- [The 360Giving forum](https://forum.threesixtygiving.org/): open for general discussions about the standard and proposed updates.
- [The issue tracker for the standard](https://github.com/ThreeSixtyGiving/standard/issues): for bug reports.You can also contact the 360Giving support team with your questions and suggestions via support@threesixtygiving.org
The [Governance and Revision Control](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/governance/) section provides further information about how proposed updates to the 360Giving Data Standard are assessed and prioritised for implementation. 

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for anyone from a UK funding organisation who wants to publish their grants data openly in the 360Giving Data Standard. 

This guide will help organisations publish data for the first time. It will also be useful to:
- People taking over responsibility for preparing and sharing 360Giving data for their organisation from a colleague.
- Anyone who wants to know more about what sharing 360Giving data involves.

It is designed to help you at any stage of the publishing process – whether you are at the very beginning of your journey and planning your approach, preparing your data, at the publishing stage, or looking for ways to promote the fact you have published, and start using the data in 360Giving tools.

We want to help you achieve your goal of publishing open and comparable grants data using the 360Giving Data Standard. This isn’t a reporting process, it’s an opportunity to let people know about your grantmaking using data.

Our pro-bono support helps funders to navigate the steps to publish their grant data using the 360Giving Data Standard. We provide guidance and direct support to help streamline the process as far as possible.

At any point in this process we invite you to contact our free Helpdesk via support@threesixtygiving.org with any queries, large or small.
