# Guidance for publishers

Guidance for publishers sets out the three key stages in the 360Giving publishing process, and highlights the options available and factors that will inform the choices you make.

These stages apply to all types of funder. However, the approach you take, the support you need, and how long the process will take can all vary, depending on a few factors:
- The information you collect about your grantmaking
- The systems you use to manage the data
- How much data you want to publish 
- Your organisational and technical capacity

### 1. Plan

You will identify the scope of the grant information you want to share by looking at the data in your systems, and comparing it with the available 360Giving Data Standard fields. You can also take inspiration from what other funders have included in their 360Giving data. Once you have identified the grant information you intend to publish, you can consider the data protection implications of sharing this data, and develop appropriate policies so you can do so responsibly.

Go to the [Planning section](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/guidance/plan-the-process/).

### 2. Prepare

Your grant information needs to be transformed into 360Giving data, using the correct formatting and headings. You will use the <a href="https://dataquality.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">360Giving Data Quality Tool</a> to check if your data is ready to be published.

For many publishers, preparing their data is a manual process that involves exporting information from a grants management system and converting it in a spreadsheet. However, some grants management systems make it possible to build-in some or all of the steps needed to convert the information, so it can be exported directly in 360Giving data format.

Go to the [Preparing section](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/guidance/prepare-data/).

### 3. Publish

Your prepared file of 360Giving data needs to be made available online accompanied with an open license, which provides clear permissions to allow for its use. This step usually involves uploading the file to your website and linking to the file with text referring to the open license. The final step is to let 360Giving know that your data has been published.

Once your file of 360Giving data has been published openly, a link to it will be added to the <a href="https://data.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">360Giving Data Registry</a>. Your grant data will then start to appear in <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">GrantNav</a>, <a href="https://insights.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">360Insights</a> and other tools and platforms that use 360Giving data.

## About grants management systems
Funders of all shapes and sizes have become 360Giving data publishers, using a wide range of grants management systems and some by collecting basic data in spreadsheets.

Where and how you collect and store information about your grants has a fundamental impact on the data you will be able to share. This will also influence the practical process taken to format your data to the 360Giving Data Standard. 

One of the first questions weâ€™ll ask when you contact 360Giving Helpdesk is what grants management systems you use. Whatever the answer, there will be useful learning we can share from our work supporting over 200 other funders to share their grants data.

Go to the [Prepare section](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/guidance/prepare-data/) for further details about the likely impact your grants management system on your publishing process.

### Publishing resources for community foundations
For community foundations using the Digits2 grants management system there is special guidance about how to use a built-in 360Giving data extract for publishing 360Giving data. Access the Community Foundations Guide to 360Giving data <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/communityfoundations/cf-publishing-guide/" target="_blank">here.
