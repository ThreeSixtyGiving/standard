# Guidance for publishers
This guide is for anyone from a UK funding organisation who wants to publish their grants data openly in the 360Giving Data Standard. 

This guide will help organisations publish 360Giving data for the first time.

It will also be useful to:
- People taking over responsibility for preparing and sharing 360Giving data for their organisation from a colleague.
- Anyone who wants to know more about what sharing 360Giving data involves.

It is designed to help you at any stage of the publishing process – whether you are at the very beginning of your journey and planning your approach, preparing your data, at the publishing stage, or starting to use the data in 360Giving tools.

We want to help you achieve your goal of publishing open and comparable grants data using the 360Giving Data Standard.

This isn’t a reporting process, it’s an opportunity to let people know about your grantmaking using data.

## About grants management systems
Funders of all shapes and sizes have become 360Giving data publishers, using a wide range of grants management systems and some by collecting basic data in spreadsheets.

Where and how you collect and store information about your grants has a fundamental impact on the data you will be able to share. This will also influence the practical process taken to format your data to the 360Giving Data Standard. 

One of the first questions we’ll ask when you contact 360Giving Helpdesk is what grants management systems you use. Whatever the answer, there will be useful learning we can share from our work supporting over 200 other funders to share their grants data.

Go to the [Prepare section](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/guidance/prepare-data/) for further details about the likely impact your grants management system on your publishing process.

### Publishing resources for community foundations
For community foundations using the Digits2 grants management system there is special guidance about how to use a built-in 360Giving data extract for publishing 360Giving data.

## Key concepts

#### Open data
360Giving data is open data, which is defined as follows:

   > Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).

For further information visit the <a href="https://opendefinition.org/" target="_blank">Open Definition website.</a>

#### 360Giving data
360Giving data is the term we use to describe any grant information shared using the 360Giving Data Standard. 360Giving data can be viewed in files published by a wide range of funders or explored in online tools built by 360Giving and others.

#### Publishers and publishing
Organisations that share 360Giving data are the owners of the information and when they make the files of data available online as open data, it is called **publishing the data**. That is why we call the funders that share 360Giving data **Publishers**.

#### JSON
The 360Giving Data Standard is defined by a JSON Schema, which describes the structure and attributes of the information can be shared. JSON, which stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, is a data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data in web applications.
