# Guidance for publishers
This guide is for UK funding organisations that want to publish their grants data openly in the 360Giving Data Standard. 

It is designed to help you at any stage of the publishing process – whether you are at the very beginning of your journey and planning your approach, preparing your data, at the publishing stage, or starting to use the data in 360Giving tools.

We want to help you achieve your goal of publishing open and comparable grants data using the 360Giving Data Standard.

This isn’t a reporting process, it’s an opportunity to let people know about your grantmaking using data.
