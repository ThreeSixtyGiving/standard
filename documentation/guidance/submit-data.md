# Submit your 360Giving data to the Data Registry
Once 360Giving data has been published by an organisation, the file must be added to the <a href="https://data.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">360Giving Data Registry</a> so that the data appears in 360Giving’s tools, including <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">GrantNav</a> and <a href="https://insights.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">360Insights</a>.

Publishers of 360Giving data can add their valid 360Giving data files to the Data Registry using the 360Giving data file submission form. 

The submission form allows users to:
- Update an existing Data Registry entry with an updated version of an existing file
- Add an entry for a new file to the Data Registry

Only publishers with an authorised website domain can use this submission process.

## Authorised domains
By default, the website domain used by existing publishers to host their 360Giving data files will be authorised.

Organisations that publish 360Giving data for the first time can also use the 360Giving data file submission process once they have registered their website domain with 360Giving. To register to your website domain prior to publishing for the first time, please contact 360Giving Helpdesk via <support@threesixtygiving.org>.

Publishers can opt out of authorising their website domain and using the 360Giving data file submission process by request.

### Which domains are not authorised?
Data files published on multi-user hosting platforms, like open data repositories or file sharing services Google Sheets or Dropbox, cannot be submitted with the 360Giving data file submission process because the domain cannot be authorised as being unique to a particular organisation. 

Files published in this way can only be added to the 360Giving Data Registry by emailing 360Giving Helpdesk via <support@threesixtygiving.org>.

## How to use the 360Giving data submission process
To add a file to the 360Giving Data Registry, it must:
- Contain valid 360Giving data, which means it has passed the <a href="https://dataquality.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">Data Quality Tool</a> checks.
- Be published online via a publicly accessible link.
- And be accompanied by an open license which gives permission for its use.

For further information read our guidance on using the [Data Quality Tool](../../guidance/data-quality/), and [publishing your data openly](../../guidance/publish-data-openly/).

You should also make sure the data is ready to be published in terms of its contents. Please only submit a file to the 360Giving Data Registry if you are sure that it includes the correct information, and there is nothing in the data that is unsuitable for publishing as open data. Find out more about what to check before publishing your data openly in our [data protection guidance](../../guidance/data-protection/).


You are only able to submit one file at a time. To submit multiple files, you will need to go through the 360Giving data file submission process for each file separately.

### 1. Submit the link to your 360Giving data file
Once your data is ready to be added to the 360Giving Data Registry, paste the link into the **Submit your data** section of the <a href="https://dataquality.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">Data Quality Tool</a>. This is below the **Check your data** section which is for testing files prior to publishing and submitting.

### 2. Provide contact details
You will be asked to provide your name and email address.

An email acknowledgement to confirm the update to the 360Giving Data Registry will be sent both to you and the primary publisher contact for the organisation (if these are different).

### 3. Pick the file submission option
If this is the first time your organisation has submitted 360Giving data to the 360Giving Data Registry, you will be taken straight to the form for adding a new file.

If your organisation has published 360Giving data before, you will be presented with two options.
- Update an existing Data Registry entry
- Submit a new Data Registry entry

If none of the grants data in the file has been published before, select the option **Submit a new Data Registry entry**.

If your file includes grants that have already been published and appear in 360Giving’s tools (such as GrantNav), this means you need to replace your existing file with an updated version, by selecting the option **Update an existing Data Registry entry**. The updated version of the file should contain all the grants that have already been published that you want to retain from the file that will be replaced.

To find out which file you need to update, check your organisation’s entry on the <a href="https://data.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">360Giving Data Registry</a>.

If you are not sure if any of the grants in your file already appear in 360Giving tools, check <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/funders" target="_blank">your organisation’s GrantNav page</a>.

#### Submit a new Data Registry entry
If you select **Submit a new Data Registry entry** the form asks you to provide the following basic information about your 360Giving data file.

- **Title and Description:** These are text fields that can be used to provide information about the name of the file and its contents, and provide further contextual information if appropriate. Title is required and has a character limit of 80 characters and will be displayed on the Data Registry. 
Description is optional and is not publicly displayed on the Data Registry website.

- **Access URL Domain:** The domain is displayed but is not editable, to ensure that the Access URL link is from the authorised domain.

- **Access URL Page Path:** This makes up the remainder link to a webpage where your data can be found, when combined with the Access URL Domain. This can be left blank if your file is hosted at your main website address, or should be the link to the page which hosts your file.

- **License:** This is the open license that applies to the data. The details of the license should normally be found alongside the link to your file on your website. 
The overwhelming majority of publishers use Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0, unless they are a public sector organisation, who should use Open Government License 3.0 instead.

For further information see our [guidance on open licences](../../guidance/publish-data-openly/).

#### Update an existing Data Registry entry
If you select **Update an existing Data Registry entry** you will be presented with a table with the five most recent Data Registry entries for the files published by your organisation. You may need to adjust the column width to view the full file titles.

Select the file entry you want to amend, and you will be taken to a form, where you will be given the opportunity to edit the **Title** and **Description** of your file. You may also edit the **Access URL Page Path**, but the Access URL Domain and Download URL are not editable.

If you have **more than five** Data Registry file entries and the file you want to update is not shown, contact 360Giving Helpdesk via <support@threesixtygiving.org> to update the file entry on your behalf.

### Agree to Terms and Conditions
Whether submitting a new entry or updating an existing one, once you have filled out the required information about your file, you will be presented with a preview of the information you have entered.

You will be asked to agree to the following on behalf of your organisation:
- You are authorised to submit this file to the 360Giving Data Registry on behalf of your organisation.
- There is no personal data in the file, or consent to share personal data has been obtained, in line with the [Publisher Guidance on Data Protection](../../guidance/data-protection/).

- Your data is ready and you give permission for the grant data in the file to appear publicly in 360Giving tools including GrantNav and 360Insights.

Click **Agree** to go to the final page, which will confirm that the update to the Data Registry has been made.

An acknowledgement email will be sent to the contact email address provided, and the email of the person marked as the primary publisher contact for your organisation in 360Giving’s systems. If this is the same email contact the acknowledgment email will only be sent once.
