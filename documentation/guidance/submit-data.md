# Submit your 360Giving data to the Data Registry
Once 360Giving data has been published by an organisation, the file must be added to the <a href="https://data.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">360Giving Data Registry</a> so that the data appears in 360Givingâ€™s tools, including <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">GrantNav</a> and <a href="https://insights.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">360Insights</a>.

Publishers of 360Giving data can add their valid 360Giving data files to the Data Registry using the 360Giving data file submission form. 

The submission form allows users to:
- Update an existing Data Registry entry with an updated version of an existing file
- Add an entry for a new file to the Data Registry

Only publishers with an authorised website domain can use this submission process.

## Authorised domains
By default, the website domain used by existing publishers to host their 360Giving data files will be authorised, unless the publisher has opted out of using the 360Giving data file submission process.

Organisations that publish 360Giving data for the first time can also use the 360Giving data file submission process once they have registered their website domain with 360Giving. To register to your website domain prior to publishing for the first time, please contact 360Giving Helpdesk via <support@threesixtygiving.org>.

### Which domains are not authorised?
Data files published on multi-user hosting platforms, like open data repositories or file sharing services Google Sheets or Dropbox, cannot be submitted with the 360Giving data file submission process because the domain cannot be authorised as being unique to a particular organisation. 

Files published in this way can only be added to the 360Giving Data Registry by emailing 360Giving Helpdesk via <support@threesixtygiving.org>.

## How to use the 360Giving data submission process
To add a file to the 360Giving Data Registry, it must:
- Contain valid 360Giving data, which means it has passed the <a href="https://dataquality.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">Data Quality Tool</a> checks.
- Be published online via a publicly accessible link.
- And be accompanied by an open license which gives permission for its use.

For further information read our guidance on using the [Data Quality Tool](../../guidance/data-quality/), and [publishing your data openly](../../guidance/publish-data-openly/).

You should also make sure the data is ready to be published in terms of its contents. Please only submit a file to the 360Giving Data Registry if you are sure that it includes the correct information, and there is nothing in the data that is unsuitable for publishing as open data. Find out more about what to check before publishing your data openly in our [data protection guidance](../../guidance/data-protection/).
