# Useful information before you start

## What to expect
This guide sets out the four key stages in the 360Giving publishing process, and highlights the options available and factors that will inform the choices you make.

The four stages are:
1. Plan
2. Prepare
3. Publish
4. Use

These stages apply to all types of funder. However, the approach you take, the support you need, and how long the process will take can all vary, depending on a few factors:
- The information you collect about your grantmaking
- The systems you use to manage the data
- How much data you want to publish 
- Your organisational and technical capacity

### 360Giving Helpdesk support is free
There are no registration fees or costs associated with publishing your grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard. 360Giving support for publishers is provided free of charge. 

Preparing 360Giving data does require a commitment of resources from the publisher in terms of staff time, especially when publishing your data for the first time. There can be costs in terms of consultancy or support fees for getting grants management systems set up to export 360Giving data. 

### 1. Plan

Identify the scope of the grant information you want to share by looking at the data in your systems, and comparing it with the available 360Giving Data Standard fields. You can also take inspiration from what other funders have included in their 360Giving data. Once you have identified the grant information you intend to publish, you can consider if there are privacy and responsible data implications of sharing this data.

### 2. Prepare

Your grant information needs to be transformed into 360Giving data, using the correct formats and headings. You can use the 360Giving Data Quality Tool to check your data is formatted correctly.

For many publishers, preparing their data is a manual process that involves converting data exported into a spreadsheet from a grants management system. However, some grants management systems make it possible to export data with some or all of the preparations needed to convert the information into 360Giving data built-in.

### 3. Publish

Your prepared file of 360Giving data needs to be made available online accompanied with an open license, which provides clear permissions to allow for its use by 360Giving and others. This step usually involves uploading the file to your website and linking to the file with text referring to the open license. The final step is to let 360Giving know that your data has been published.

Once your file of 360Giving data has been published openly, a link to it will be added to the [360Giving Data Registry](https://data.threesixtygiving.org/). Your grant data will then start to appear in GrantNav, 360Insights and other tools and platforms that use 360Giving data.

## About grants management systems
Grantmakers of all shapes and sizes have become 360Giving data publishers, using a wide range of grants management systems and some by collecting basic data in spreadsheets.

Where and how you collect and store information about your grants has a fundamental impact on the data you will be able to share. This will also influence the practical process taken to format your data to the 360Giving Data Standard. 

One of the first questions we’ll ask you when you start on your 360Giving publishing journey is what grants management systems you use. Whatever the answer, there will be useful learning we can share from our work supporting over 200 other funders to share their grants data.

*See the ‘Prepare’ section for further details about the likely impact your grants management system will have on the publishing process.* (Link to be added)
