# Using 360Giving data
At 360Giving, we help funders publish open data about who, what and where they fund, using the 360Giving Data Standard.

This means they are sharing information about their funding in a way that others can access and use, for free. Because the data is standardised, it can be looked at and analysed all together, helping us all to understand grantmaking across the UK.

## 360Giving online tools
We have developed tools to make the data easier for people to explore.

### GrantNav
