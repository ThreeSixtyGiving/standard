# Plan your process and data
By the end of this stage you will have a plan for the scope of the data you want to publish. This takes data protection into consideration.

Key tasks
- Contact the 360Giving Helpdesk to let us know that you want to publish your grant data.
- Decide what information to publish – the scope of the fields, what time period your data will cover and whether you will be sharing data about all of your grants.
- Determine whether there are any Data Protection and Privacy considerations, and review your policies to ensure you can share your data responsibly.

## How long the process takes
The amount of time it takes to prepare and share 360Giving data can vary depending on your circumstances. The amount of data to be published, and whether the data is well-organised and consistent are key factors in determining how long the process will take. 

It will be possible to estimate the work involved once you have decided on the scope of your data, as set out in the ‘Plan’ section below. (link needed)

## Decide what information to share
The full 360Giving Data Standard is comprehensive, with over 100 fields available to describe information about grants, recipients and funding organisations, programmes, locations and more.

There are 10 core fields of information which all 360Giving data must include. 
These fields ensure that the data will be usable and describe the who, what, when and how much of each grant. 

### 10 core fields
Seven of these fields are commonly collected as part of the grantmaking process and may be found in a grants management system: 
1. Grant identifier
2. Grant amount
3. Grant award date
4. Grant or project title
5. Grant or project description
6. Recipient name
7. Recipient identifier

Three pieces of information are usually added as part of the data preparation process:
8. Funder name
9. Funder identifier
10. Currency

#### Recommended fields
All other fields are optional, however the majority of publishers do share a range of further information.

The following types of information are commonly shared.
- Recipient location
- Beneficiary location
- Grant programme details
- Grant duration and/or planned start and end dates
- Classifications
- Metadata

Including this information in your data will make it more useful and help users to understand your grantmaking better.

You can be pragmatic when making these choices. If you have information available, consider including it. If you don’t collect certain data or the information is not relevant to your grantmaking, these fields can be left out. For example not all funders have programmes, and location information may be irrelevant to grants awarded for policy or research.

It is possible to start by publishing simpler information and over time, extend the range of fields you include.

#### Additional fields
If you have information that doesn’t fit any of the 360Giving Data Standard fields provided, it is ok to include this in additional fields. 

A file of 360Giving data can include any number of non-Standard fields, however you will need to take care with the titles and make sure the data formatting is consistent.

### Decide what kind of grants to include
360Giving is a voluntary initiative and you can decide what information to share in your open grants data, based on what is appropriate to your circumstances. 

While most 360Giving publishers include data about all their grants, there are examples of those who share data about certain programmes but not others or grants over a certain size. It is common for funders that give grants to individuals and organisations to only publish data about their grants to organisations.

If your goal is to publish data about all your grants but there are practical or policy issues to address first, consider which grant programmes or records are unaffected by such barriers, and move forward with publishing these. The learning from this process can then be applied back to other areas of your grantmaking once the issues are resolved.

#### Decide whether to shrae historical grant data
You can publish data going as far back as you want (and have data for) or focus on sharing information about recent grants.

Some funders have published many years of historical data, while others have started by sharing data about the past year or recent grant award rounds. The decision about how much historical data to share is often informed by practical considerations.

These questions will help you to decide.
- How accurate and complete is the data in your systems?
If there are gaps or inaccuracies in your older data, then start from a point where you are confident in the quality of the information.
- Is your past grantmaking similar to your current funding priorities?
If your historical grant awards are not representative of what you fund now, you may prefer to start from the beginning of your most recent grantmaking strategy.

The more grant data you can share, the greater the benefit to users of 360Giving data. However, if you start by publishing recent grants, you can decide to include more historical data at a future point.

## Taking inspiration from what others have published
You may find it helpful to look at the data published by other grantmakers when deciding the scope of the data you want to share and to see what it looks like in practice.

We can also put you in touch with grantmakers who can share relevant experiences with you. 

#### Data Registry
360Giving Data Registry is the list of organisations that publish to the 360Giving Data Standard. You can access and download full files of published data: https://data.threesixtygiving.org/

#### GrantNav
GrantNav is a search-engine for grants data. You can explore and download data about where funding goes and how much is given across billions of pounds of grants. You can access GrantNav at https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org

Each grant record has its own page with the 10 core fields showing at the top. The other fields that have been shared are displayed in a table.

As well as looking at a single grant record view you can view lists:
- Grants awarded to a particular organisation.
- Grants to recipients located in a particular place.

You can also search the data by keyword. For example, this search shows grants awarded with the term ‘village hall’ in the grant title or description: https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/search?query=%22village+hall%22&default_field=title_and_description 

For more guidance about how to explore 360Giving data in GrantNav visit https://help.grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest 

#### 360Insights
360Insights is a tool to help you understand funders better. You can combine and visualise 360Giving and charity data, and explore funding across different areas – from grant dates to types of recipients: https://insights.threesixtygiving.org

You can filter the 360Insights dashboard to see results for grants based on grant programme, organisation type, size or region.
