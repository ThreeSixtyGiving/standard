# DEI Guidance

## Introduction

This guide is for UK funding organisations that want to publish data collected using the DEI Data Standard alongside 360Giving grants data. It is designed to help you whether you are at the very beginning of your journey and planning your approach or preparing your data.

This guidance provides further information about the DEI Data Standard and the 360Giving Data Standard’s DEI Extension which has been developed to support the sharing of DEI Data Standard data alongside 360Giving data.

This isn’t a reporting process, it’s an opportunity to collect and share data that will create a knowledge-base to support effective action to identify and target funding to address structural inequity.

## About the DEI Standard

The [DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) Data Standard](https://www.funderscollaborativehub.org.uk/dei-data-standard) was created by an independent working group of UK funders, known as the DEI Data Group, who believe that without an effective framework to capture equity data there can be no effective action to identify and target funding to address structural inequity. The DEI Data Group agreed on a shared framework (classifications, language and approach) which aims to categorise organisations either led by, or targeting and supporting groups experiencing structural inequity.

The DEI Data Standard defines a taxonomy to describe population groups and an approach to collecting the data. In the context of grantmaking, these taxonomies may be applied to describe various aspects of the organisation and people involved in a project funded by a grant. These taxonomies can be applied to describe the following three areas:

* **People receiving primary benefits/service users** of the project or the organisation
* **Mission and purpose** of the organisation
* **Leadership** of the organisation

### Why collect and share DEI Data Standard data?

Collecting and sharing DEI Data Standard information is intended to enable funders to understand whether the reach of the funding and their funding practices are equitable. Information shared in this way can then be used to inform funding strategies and specific funding programmes or approaches.

It is important to note that the DEI Data Standard is about understanding **equity** rather than diversity. It aims to help funders to answer the question – is our grantmaking reaching communities facing structural inequity, and in particular is the money going to organisations led by people from those communities?

The goal of developing the DEI Data Standard and framework for applying it was to increase the equity of grantmaking through having good quality and consistent data to monitor this, and to enable shared reporting, while also reducing the burden on applicants around data collection through grantmakers using a consistent approach.

### How to collect DEI Data Standard Data

The DEI Data Standard isn’t one size fits all and so it has been designed with options in how the data is collected to suit different funding approaches. For example a funder making a large volume of grants will probably make different choices to a funder who makes fewer grants.

Full information about the DEI Data Standard, including details of the taxonomy and approach, and guidance on how to apply these to different grantmaking contexts can be found on the ‘The DEI Data Standard’ section of the [Funders Collaborative Hub](https://www.funderscollaborativehub.org.uk/dei-data-standard)


## About the DEI Extension

The DEI Extension is an extension to the 360Giving Data Standard. 

360Giving has developed the DEI Extension to enable publication of DEI Data Standard information related to grants as a single dataset alongside 360Giving data. This ties the DEI Data Standard information directly to the context of the grant, making it easier to publish, manage, and analyse.

The extension adds new fields to the 360Giving Data Standard which can be used to include data collected in accordance with the DEI Data Standard. This allows 360Giving tools to validate the DEI Data Standard information alongside the rest of the 360Giving data fields leading to better data quality for analysis and a better understanding of the equity of grantmaking and the collective grantmaking picture.

Detailed technical information for the DEI Extension is available on the `$DEI-REFERENCE` page. It contains a reference for the fields and codes added by the DEI Extension.

### What is covered in the DEI Extension

The DEI Extension includes a number of fields important to properly situate DEI Data Standard information in the context of grantmaking. This includes both the answers themselves, but also important metadata such as the purposes of collecting the information and whether a question was asked, and how.

The DEI Extension follows the DEI Data Standard’s guidelines on the application of its taxonomy which is applied to grants in three different areas:

* People receiving the primary benefits / service users - titled **Project** in the extension
* The mission and purpose of the organisation - titled **Mission**
* The leadership of the organisation - titled **Leadership**

For each of these areas you may provide the responses to the questions in the form of DEI Data Standard Taxonomy codes as well as free text responses such as lived experience or geographical area.

In addition to the fields for providing response, there are also fields to provide metadata describing the whether questions were asked, how they were asked, and whether there has been a response. These metadata fields are important to contextualise the data to avoid ambiguity and support data users analysing and understanding the data correctly.

Funders are able to make choices about how they implement the DEI Data Standard based on their specific context. This is an important feature of the DEI Data Standard, but leads to variations in the data collected which must then be contextualised to be understood correctly.

For example, funders making grants to small organisations or providing unrestricted funding for the benefit of the whole organisation might opt to only ask applicants questions about the **Mission** and the **Leadership** of the organisation as the **Project** users are likely to be the same as the Mission of the organisation, whereas other funders may ask questions about all three application areas. A data user looking at this data side-by-side may not know whether the first funder didn’t ask about the Project or whether the data is missing from the file.

The metadata fields in the DEI Extension address this by communicating this context. They allow the first funder to show that questions about the Project weren’t asked or weren’t applicable so that a data user understands more about the context.

Some important metadata fields included in the DEI Extension are:

* Whether the information was asked for, and how
* What options were available to the respondents when the information was asked for
* Which levels of classification (*Population Group*, *Category*, *Subcategory*) from the taxonomy were available as responses
* The status of the reply to the question (e.g. “No reply”)

## Support Available
