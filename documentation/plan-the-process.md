# Plan your process and data
By the end of this stage you will have a plan for the scope of the data you want to publish, taking data protection into consideration.

```eval_rst
.. admonition:: Key tasks

  1. Decide what information to publish – the scope of the fields, what time period your data will cover and whether you will be sharing data about all of your grants.
  
  2. Check if there are any Data Protection and Privacy considerations, and review your policies to ensure you can share your data responsibly.
```

## How long the process takes
The amount of time it takes to prepare and share 360Giving data can vary depending on your circumstances. The key factors that can determine how long the process will take are:
- The type of grants management system used
- The amount of data to be published
- Whether the data is well-organised and consistent
- If key data is poor quality or missing

It will normally be possible to estimate the work involved once you have decided on the scope of your data.

```

## Decide what information to share
The full 360Giving Data Standard is comprehensive, with over 100 fields available to describe information about grants, recipients and funding organisations, programmes, locations and more.

There are **10 core fields** of information which all 360Giving data must include. These fields ensure that the data will be usable and describe the **who, what, when and how much** of each grant.

### 10 core fields
Seven of the 10 core fields are commonly collected as part of the grantmaking process, and may be stored in a grants management system: 
- Grant identifier
- Grant amount
- Grant award date
- Grant or project title
- Grant or project description
- Recipient name
- Recipient identifier

Three pieces of information are usually added as part of the data preparation process:
- Funder name
- Funder identifier
- Currency

#### Recommended fields
Apart from the 10 core fields, all other fields are optional. However the majority of publishers do share a range of further information which make the data more useful and help users to understand their grantmaking better.

The following types of information are commonly shared.
- Recipient location
- Beneficiary location
- Grant duration and/or planned start and end dates
- Grant programme details
- Metadata

You can be pragmatic when making these choices. If you have this recommended information available, then consider including it.

If you don’t collect certain data or the information is not relevant to your grantmaking, these fields can be left out of your 360Giving data. For example not all funders have programmes, and location information may not be relevant to grants awarded for policy or research.

It is possible to start by publishing simpler information and over time, extend the range of fields you include.

#### Further information about core and recommended fields
You can view and download further details about the core, recommended and optional fields in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1klj0PzxrlnBPhodpEQC7tD6aRNuEjVNeNHVRvIv66b4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Notes about the 360Giving Data Standard.</a> (link opens in Google Sheets)

For further information about all the possible fields in the 360Giving Data Standard visit the [Reference section.](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/reference/) 

#### Additional fields
If you have information that doesn’t fit any of the 360Giving Data Standard fields provided, you can include these in additional fields. 

A file of 360Giving data can include any number of **non-Standard** fields, however you will need to take care with the titles and make sure the data formatting is consistent.

For guidance on naming your own fields visit the [Additional fields section.](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/reference/#additional-fields)

### Decide what kind of grants to include
360Giving is a voluntary initiative and you can decide what information to share in your open grants data, based on what is appropriate to your circumstances. 

While most 360Giving publishers include data about all their grants, there are examples of those who share data about certain programmes but not others, or only grants over a certain value. It is common for funders that give grants to individuals and to organisations to only publish data about their grants to organisations.

If your goal is to publish data about all your grants but you find there are practical or policy issues to address first, work out which grant programmes or records are unaffected by these barriers, and move forward with publishing these. The learning from this process can then be applied to other areas of your grantmaking once the issues are resolved.

#### Decide whether to share historical grant data
You can publish data going as far back as you want (and have data for) or focus on sharing information about recent grants.

Some funders have published many years of historical data, while others have started by sharing data about the past year or recent grant award rounds. The decision about how much historical data to share is often informed by practical considerations.

These questions will help you to decide.
- How accurate and complete is the data in your systems?
If there are gaps or inaccuracies in your older data, then start from a point where you are confident in the quality of the information.
- Is your past grantmaking similar to your current funding priorities?
If your historical grant awards are not representative of what you fund now, you may prefer to start from the beginning of your most recent grantmaking strategy.

The more grant data you can share, the greater the benefit to users of 360Giving data. However, if you start by publishing recent grants, you can decide to include more historical data at a future point.

## Taking inspiration from what others have published
You may find it helpful to look at the data published by other grantmakers when deciding the scope of the data you want to share and to see what it looks like in practice.

We can also put you in touch with grantmakers who can share relevant experiences with you. 

#### Data Registry
360Giving Data Registry is a list of all the organisations that publish their grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard, with direct links to their data sources.

You can access and download files on the Data Registry <a href="https://data.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">here.</a>

#### GrantNav
GrantNav is a search-engine for grants data. You can explore and download data about where funding goes and how much is given across billions of pounds of grants.

You can access GrantNav <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">here.</a>

Each grant record has its own page with the 10 core fields showing at the top. The other fields that have been shared are displayed in a table.

As well as looking at a single grant record view you can view lists:
- <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/recipient/GB-CHC-219278" target="_blank">Grants awarded to a particular organisation</a>
- <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/district/Shropshire" target="_blank">Grants to recipients located in a particular place</a>

You can also search the data by keyword. For example, this search shows grants awarded with the <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/search?query=%22village+hall%22&default_field=title_and_description" target="_blank">term ‘village hall’ in the grant title or description.</a>

- You can download the results of your searches to see what data from a range of funders looks like.
- You can also open the results of a search in <a href="https://insights.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">360Insights.</a>

For more guidance about how to explore 360Giving data in GrantNav visit the <a href="https://help.grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest" target="_blank">Help section.</a>

#### 360Insights
360Insights is a tool to help you understand funders better. You can combine and visualise 360Giving and charity data, and explore funding across different areas – from grant dates to types of recipients.

You can access 360Insights <a href="https://insights.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">here.</a>

You can filter the 360Insights dashboard to see results for grants based on grant programme, organisation type, size or region.

## Data protection and responsible data sharing
Once you have decided the scope of the information you want to share, it is important to carefully consider if there are any privacy or data protection implications to publishing your grant data.

### Data protection and 360Giving data
The data collected by funders about the awards made to grantees belongs to the funder, and information about organisations and the grants they receive is not personal data. However, grants to individuals, grants to smaller organisations, or named contact details for organisations, may contain or constitute personal data.

In general, **open data should not contain personal or sensitive personal data that could allow a living person to be identified**. Data to be published using the 360Giving Data Standard which does relate to identified individuals should be removed or anonymised to protect their privacy. 

Although there are circumstances where publishing personal data is in the public interest, in the case of 360Giving data, personal data should only be included with the consent of the individual concerned.

The guidance below sets out what to consider when publishing your grant data openly for the first time, and notifying your grantees about your 360Giving data.

#### Check your privacy policies and grant agreements
If your organisation already announces details of grants through annual reports, web pages or press releases, you should already have processes in place that establish your rights to share this information publicly. 

- Check the terms of your grant agreements for any existing clauses relating to publicity and disclosure of information about grants. 
- Check if your organisation has a privacy policy, or terms and conditions that applicants agree to when submitting grant applications.

#### Reviewing your policies
When reviewing your grant agreement or terms and conditions:

Include:
- An explicit statement that public information might be shared in open datasets.
- A clear statement of scope (state whether you will release just summary information, or you will release detailed grant information, including payments and results).
- If applicable, a clear statement of any personally identifying information you plan to publish (e.g. names, addresses), and details of how grantees should opt-in, or opt-out of which data being shared.

Avoid:
- Statements that imply published information will only be used by specific partner organisations (as this restriction cannot be placed on openly licensed data).

### Public vs personal information
Attention should be paid to any data you intend to publish which may be personally identifying under the Data Protection Act 2018, including:
- Grants to named individuals.
- The contact person, and their contact details, at an organisation you have funded.
- Personal/residential addresses, for example when an organisation is registered at a home address.

If you intend to publish information about individuals that could be personally identifying, you should either:
1. Make sure you have explicit opt-in consent to publish this within an open dataset.
2. Or remove or anonymise the information in line with the Information Commissioner's <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf" target="_blank">anonymisation code of practice.</a>

### If you are not publishing personal data
In general, information about organisations and the grants they have received can be published as open 360Giving data without concern. 

However you should still check for personal data appearing by accident. For example descriptive text may include the names or contact details of individuals involved in a project or organisation. 
- Check **Title**, **Description** and **Recipient Org:Description** fields, as well as recipient or beneficiary location data, to ensure that this information, on its own or when combined, cannot be used to identify the individual concerned. 
- Pay particular attention to any text fields where the source information is entered by applicants via an online application form, especially if the text does not get checked and edited during the grant assessment process.

If you need take further steps to anonymise or remove potentially identifying data, make a note of the changes you make to ensure these checks and steps are taken each time you publish new data.

#### Organisations registered at a home address
If the address of an organisation is a private home address, which can be the case for grassroots or informal groups and small registered charities, this information is not suitable for inclusion in 360Giving data in full.

Redacting street-level addresses, and including only the postal town and the postcode may be sufficient to prevent the information from identifying an individual. However the appropriate approach to redaction will depend on the context of the data, for example by only including the first digits of the postcode if the address is in a sparsely populated rural area.

Some publishers avoid the possibility of publishing home address data by sharing recipient location data using geocodes instead of address information. 

This option has been used by funders who frequently fund smaller or informal groups where there is a high likelihood of home addresses appearing in their data. This approach also suits funders who award large volumes of grants where distinguishing which recipients use home addresses would be challenging or time-consuming.

For further information see our [guidance about how to convert postcodes into geocodes.](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/new-docs-style/guidance/prepare-data/#converting-postcodes-into-geocodes-to-anonymise-address-information)

### If you intend to publish personal data
We encourage publishers to carefully consider the value of publishing any personal information as part of their 360Giving data and discourage sharing of special category data (including racial or ethnic origin and health information).

Before making a decision on including personal data:
- Review the ICO’s <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/" target="_blank">Key definitions of the data protection act</a> to understand the difference between non-personal data, personal data and sensitive personal data;
- Review the ICO’s <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/" target="_blank">Guide to data protection</a> to understand your organisation’s obligations;
- Ensure your organisation has the power to <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-sharing-information-hub/" target="_blank">share the data</a>.

#### Grants to named individuals
The 360Giving Data Standard was designed for publishing data about grants awarded to organisations, however it is possible to publish grants awarded to individuals as well. 

In this case, all personally identifying data should be appropriately anonymised unless informed consent to publicly share the information has been given by the individual concerned. 

Examples of how to anonymise personally identifying data include: 
- Replacing individual names with ‘Grant to individual’.
- Redacting street-level addresses, and including just postal town or the first part of the postcode (known in the UK as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom#Outward_code" target="_blank">the Outward code</a>) or converting postcode data into geocodes. **Note**: the appropriate approach to redaction will depend on the context of the data.
- Replacing individual contact person names with their roles (e.g. Project Manager) and generic email addresses.

#### Seeking consent to include personal data
In cases where you do wish to seek permission to include personal or sensitive personal information in your 360Giving data, it is important to make sure grantees are aware of:
- The specific scope of personal data to be published.
- The terms under which it will be made available as open data.

You can find a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/" target="_blank">definition of personal data and sensitive personal data</a> – known as special category data – on the Information Commissioner’s website.

For example, if you were looking to publish names and abbreviated location information, you might include:
> "We are seeking your permission to include the contact person for your grant and the first part of your postcode (known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom#Outward_code" target="_blank">the Outward code</a>), alongside other general grant information, as part of open data about our grant making. This information will be included in a public dataset under an open license. This means that any third party is free to access and re-use the data."

You will need to write the permission request based on the particular data you plan to publish.

#### Managing consent
Consider including additional fields in your internal data systems to log:
- When a grant record includes <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/what-is-personal-data/" target="_blank">personal, or personally identifying</a>, data (e.g. an individual’s residential address as the registered address of a charity; grants to named individuals) or otherwise sensitive data (e.g. grants to a refuge or other location that should not be disclosed for safety reasons).
- Whether or not consent has been obtained.

Be aware that consent can be withdrawn at any time so you will also need to put in place processes to trigger a change to your open grants data if that happens.

360Giving has a Take Down policy which sets out how we respond to requests to remove any published data linked from our Data Registry and loaded into our tools. You can read the 360Giving Take Down policy <a href="https://threesixtygiving.org/take-down-policy" target="_blank">here.</a>

#### Start by publishing what you can
You can still take steps toward publishing your data, even if you find that there are some data protection policy issues to address. Consider which fields and grant records are not affected by any barriers, and move forward with publishing these. The learning from this process can then be applied back to other grants once the policy issues are resolved.

### Responsible data
There can be cases where grant data is sensitive for reasons other than privacy. For example, the address of a women’s refuge might be inappropriate to include in data about a grant to that organisation.

Consider whether any of your grant data might contain other sensitive information, and make sure you have a process in place to review and redact it (or seek consent to publish) where required.

**Sharing Data Responsibly – A Conversation Guide for Funders** is designed for funders and grantmakers who want practical advice on how to treat their grantees’ data responsibly. Published by the Ariadne Network and Engine Room, this report is aimed at Human Rights funders working internationally, but has relevant information for all other types of funders.

You can access the Responsible Data guide <a href="http://www.ariadne-network.eu/sharing-data-responsibly-conversation-guide-funders/" target="_blank">here.</a>

The guide follows the grant management cycle, providing information to guide decisions at each stage:
- **Data collecting**: managing data in the application, monitoring and reporting phases.
- **Storing grantee data**: how to provide clear information on which data is collected and why, and how you will store it.
- **Sharing and publishing information**: sharing and publishing information in a considered, responsible way.

### Notifying grantees about your 360Giving data
Even if you will not be sharing personally identifying information and so do not need to gather extra consents, you may wish to let your grantees know about your 360Giving publication, as a courtesy. This can also be a good opportunity to solicit any updates from them.

If your organisation has not shared detailed information about your grants before, your communication can provide reassurance that their personal data will continue to be handled in accordance with your privacy policy, and also provide an opportunity to outline the benefits.

For example, in your communication with grantees you could cover the following:

#### What data will be published?
The data will include the name of the grant recipient organisation, amount, date and a brief description of the purpose of the grant. (This section should be updated to reflect the fields included in your data.)

#### How will data be published?
The data will be available to download from our website (insert link). The data will then be available for tools that use open data, for example [GrantNav](https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/). This is a tool created by 360Giving, but anyone could create a tool that uses the data.

#### Why are you publishing data in this way?
We are proud to be associated with our partner organisations and this is a way to share information about our collective work that can support learning and better decision-making in the charitable giving sector. Publishing open data about grants awarded in this way complements the news shared about the partners’ work and achievements.

For more information about the 360Giving initiative visit their website: <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/" target="_blank">https://www.threesixtygiving.org/</a>

### Example open data policy
An example of <a href="https://github.com/opendataservices/opendatapolicy" target="_blank">an open data policy</a> is available, written by some of the experts who helped create the 360Giving Data Standard. It can be used as a template for any organisation’s data policy and adjusted to reflect specific circumstances and needs.

Adopting an open data policy for your organisation will help to guide the checks you make before publishing data, and record the range and type of changes that may need to be made to your grant information before sharing it openly.
