# Next steps once you've published your data
Publishing open grants data for the first time is a cause for celebration! In addition to sharing the good news and exploring your grants data in 360Giving tools, it can be a good idea to make a note of your process for future reference.

## Share the news
How can using grants data support your work?

### Celebrate publishing your grants data using the 360Giving Data Standard
Your information will contribute to the understanding of grantmaking across the UK.

## Use 360Giving data
The 360Giving Data Standard enables funders to share information about their grants in a way that anyone can access and use, for free. Because the data is standardised, it can be looked at and analysed all together, helping us all to understand grantmaking across the UK.

360Giving has developed tools to make the data easier for people to explore.
