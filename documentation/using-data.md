# Using 360Giving data
The 360Giving Data Standard enables funders to share information about their grants in a way that anyone can access and use, for free. Because the data is standardised, it can be looked at and analysed all together, helping us all to understand grantmaking across the UK.

360Giving has developed tools to make the data easier for people to explore.
- **GrantNav**

GrantNav is a search-engine for grants data. You can explore and download data about where funding goes and how much is given across billions of pounds of grants.
You can access GrantNav <a href="https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">here.</a>
- **360Insights**

360Insights is a tool to help you understand funders better. You can combine and visualise 360Giving and charity data, and explore funding across different areas â€“ from grant dates to types of recipients.
You can access 360Insights <a href="https://insights.threesixtygiving.org" target="_blank">here.</a>
- **Data Registry**

360Giving Data Registry is a list of all the organisations that publish their grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard, with direct links to their data sources.
