# Using 360Giving Data

The 360Giving Data Standard enables funders to share information about their grants in a way that anyone can access and use, for free. Because the data is standardised, it can be looked at and analysed all together, helping us all to understand grantmaking across the UK.

360Giving has developed tools to make the data easier for people to explore

* GrantNav: [https://grantnav.threesixtygiving.org/]

A search-engine for grants data. Explore and download in detail on where and how much funding goes across billions of pounds of grants.

* 360Insights: [https://insights.threesixtygiving.org/]

A tool to combine and visualise 360Giving and charity data to understand funders better. You can explore funding across different areas â€“ from grant dates to types of recipients.

* Data Registry: [https://data.threesixtygiving.org/]

A list of all the organisations that currently publish their grants data in the 360Giving Data Standard, with direct links to their data sources.
