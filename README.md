360Giving Standard
========

360Giving aims to help UK grant makers and philanthropists to publish their grant information online in an easy to use way.  We are motivated by a commitment to the value of open data and strategic funding.

The **360Giving Data Standard** provides a common approach for publishing grant data. 

For more about the overall project, visit the main [360Giving website](http://threesixtygiving.com/about/).

Full documentation of the data standard is provided at [http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard](http://www.threesixtygiving.org/standard/)

## Schema and tools

From Version 1.0 of the schema and onwards:

* The authoritative source of the standard is found in [360-giving-schema.json](schema/360-giving-schema.json) and [360-giving-package-schema.json](schema/360-giving-package-schema.sjon) in [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) format (the former describes what a grant should look like, the second describes how to package up multiple grants into a single JSON file).
* Two secondary serialisation templates are generated using the [flatten-tool](https://github.com/opendataservices/flatten-tool): a summary table (CSV/XLS), and multi-table template (XLS)
* A JSON Table Schema is provided for the summary table

This repository stores the latest versions of the schema, along with tools used in generating secondary serialisations and documentation.

## Editing documentation

Documentation can now be edited directly in the [documentation](documentation) directory.

### Installation

To build the documentation you will need a virtual environment set up. 

```
git clone https://github.com/ThreeSixtyGiving/standard.git
cd standard
git submodule init
git submodule update
python3 -m virtualenv -p $(which python3) .ve
source .ve/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In Windows, instead of `source .ve/bin/activate` run `pyenv\Scripts\activate.bat`

### Build the docs

```
cd documentation
make html
```

Then open `_build/html/index.html` in your browser.

### Adding a new branch on Read the Docs

Make sure you are a "Maintainer" of the Read the Docs project. If you are, you will see an Admin button on https://readthedocs.org/projects/threesixtygiving-standard/. If not, you can request access via code@opendataservices.coop.

If your branch has been recently created, then you need to trigger a build (of any other branch) in order for Read the Docs to refresh the branch list (due to [this bug](https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/337#issuecomment-13445779)).

Then hit the [Versions button](https://readthedocs.org/projects/threesixtygiving-standard/builds/), and "Edit" next to the branch you want to set up. Then tick "Active" and hit "Save".

This should also trigger a build, which you can see via the [Builds button](https://readthedocs.org/projects/threesixtygiving-standard/builds/).
